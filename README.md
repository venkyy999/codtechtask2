ðŸ”¹ Title:
Home Automation System Using MQTT and ESP32

ðŸ”¹ Introduction:
This project aims to control home appliances, such as a light or a fan, remotely over the internet using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WiFi. An ESP32 microcontroller is used to connect to a wireless network and communicate with a lightweight MQTT broker.
The main components â€” the ESP32, a relay, and an MQTT broker â€” collectively enable real-time control of devices from a phone or computer.

ðŸ”¹ Applications:
âœ… Smart Home â€” control appliances remotely.
âœ… Energy Efficiency â€” turning off appliances when not in use.
âœ… Security â€” activate/deactivate alarm or lighting remotely.
âœ… Scalable â€” can be expanded to control more appliances.

ðŸ”¹ Advantages:
âœ… Wireless control: no messy wires for control signals.
âœ… Scalable: adding more appliances simply means adding more topics and GPIOs.
âœ… Cost-effective: ESP32 and relays are low-cost components.
âœ… Platform-Independent: control from phone, computer, or any MQTT client.

ðŸ”¹ Components:
Component	Quantity	Description
ESP32	1	Main controller with in-built WiFi
Relay Module	1	To control high-load appliances
5V Power Supply	1	To power ESP32
Breadboard & Jumpers	â€“	To connect components
LED or Bulb	1	To visualize output
MQTT Broker	â€”	Local or Cloud (like HiveMQ, Mosquitto)
WiFi Router	1	Provide network to connect ESP32 and phone
Smartphone or Laptop	1	To send messages through MQTT client or phone App

ðŸ”¹ Working Principle:
âž¥ The ESP32 connects to your home's WiFi network.
âž¥ Once connected, it subscribes to a specific MQTT topic (like home/relay1) on the broker.
âž¥ Whenever a message ('1' or '0') is published to this topic, the ESP32's callback function executes and switches the GPIO HIGH or LOW.
âž¥ The relay then activates or deactivates the connected appliance.
âž¥ An MQTT client (such as MQTT Dashboard App, Python script, or Command Line Tool) can control the relay remotely.

// See previously provided code for complete Source
// Main highlights:
// - Initializes MQTT
// - Subscribes to "home/relay1"
// - Callback parses messages and controls GPIO
ðŸ”¹ Testing:
âœ… After uploading the code to ESP32:
âž¥ The ESP32 should connect to your WiFi.
âž¥ It then connects to the MQTT broker.
âž¥ Once connected, it waits for messages on the home/relay1 topic.
âž¥ If you publish '1' to this topic, the relay turns ON; if '0', it turns OFF.

âœ… To test:
âž¥ Use MQTT.fx, HiveMQ, or phone apps like MQTT Dash.
âž¥ Publish messages to home/relay1.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how to control physical appliances remotely using IoT technology (WiFi and MQTT).
It highlights:
âœ… The power of low-cost hardware (ESP32)
âœ… The lightweight communication protocol (MQTT)
âœ… The ability to implement scalable and flexible automation.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:
âœ… Controlled from a custom App or GUI:
Design a phone application to send messages directly to the ESP32.

âœ… Add Sensors:
Monitor temperature, motion, or smoke alongside control signals.

âœ… Security:
Add Username/ Password authentication and SSL/TLS encryption to MQTT messages.

âœ… Voice control:
Pair with Amazon Alexa or Google Home for voice-activated control.
